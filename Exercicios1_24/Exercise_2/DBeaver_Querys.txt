2.1. Which users spent more money on purchases;
SELECT TOP 5 u.username, SUM(p.price) AS total_spent
FROM raw.sales s
JOIN raw.products p ON s.product_id = p.id
JOIN raw.users u ON s.user_id = u.id
GROUP BY u.username
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;


2.2. Considering that for each sale we will also have the quantity of products sold, calculate the sold quantity by producto;
SELECT p.name, COUNT(s.product_id) AS sold_quantity
FROM raw.sales s
JOIN raw.products p ON s.product_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.name
ORDER BY sold_quantity DESC;


2.3.  What was the average spent on purchases;
SELECT ROUND(AVG(total_spent), 2) AS avg_spent_per_purchase
FROM (
    SELECT
        s.user_id,
        s.sales_ts,
        SUM(p.price) AS total_spent
    FROM raw.sales s
    JOIN raw.products p ON s.product_id = p.id
    GROUP BY s.user_id, s.sales_ts
) AS subquery;



2.4.  Which top 3 users had the higher average reviews;
SELECT TOP 3 u.username, ROUND(AVG(r.rating), 2) AS avg_rating
FROM raw.reviews r
JOIN raw.users u ON r.user_id = u.id
GROUP BY u.username
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;


2.5.  Which products had the highest average reviews.
SELECT TOP 3 p.name AS producto_name, ROUND(AVG(r.rating), 2) AS avg_rating
FROM raw.reviews r
JOIN raw.products p ON r.product_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.id, p.name
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;
